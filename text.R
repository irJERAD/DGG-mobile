discNameModal <- "For each disc you have or plan on using with this app you must input its information here. Name, Color, and Weight will be used to help you discern your different discs from each other later on in the apps data visualization and storytelling portions. Data disc flight numbers, age, type and weight will be used to compute statistics in order to provide insights for you on what your discs do and how that has changed over time and practice."
